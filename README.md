- Install OpenOCD (and try the run.sh in openocd)

- Install Symbiflow arch defs:
https://github.com/SymbiFlow/symbiflow-arch-defs
and build the environment (make env)
in build/xc/xc7/

make counter_zybo_z7_bit

Not sure zybo board settingts will work but we can try.
If not I'll have to make my own board settings.

Maybe try as well:
